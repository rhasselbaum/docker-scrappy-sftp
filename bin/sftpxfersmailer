"""Listens to log traffic from OpenSSH's "internal-sftp" subsystem on a socket
and generates one transfer log per session, which it then emails.

Input received on the socket is relayed to standard output. This script relies
on a helper (refreshchrootloglinks), which creates hard links from each user's
chroot jail to the shared log socket.

This script must run as root, but drops privileges once its sockets are set up.

The 'MAIL_TO' environment variable sets the destination for emailed transfer
logs. If unset. no emails are sent but the SFTP logs are relayed to
standard output for monitoring. A 'MAIL_FROM' environment variable can be set,
as well, to specify the FROM address. If left unset, 'root' is used.
